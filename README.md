# Clojure HelloFX

Toy project to investigate building native images for JavaFX applications written in clojure.

A simple Hello World application with Java 11+, JavaFX 15+, Clojure 1.10 and GraalVM.

Aims to duplicate what [gluon sample HelloFX](https://github.com/gluonhq/gluon-samples/tree/master/HelloFX) does in clojure with the github CI support to build native images.
